Before the kepplar data could be used for machine learning, it had to be stripped of any unique features and useless values. Then we normalized all our values because a perceptron performs optimally with normalized data. We also had to label all this data because the techinques we wanted to use both are supervised learning algorithms. We accomplished this by finding a list of planets from the kepplar data set on the nasa website that are known to be in the habitiable zone, and labeling all those with a binary label of yes and the rest with a binary label of no. We also used resampling to improve the size of our dataset because we only had about 20 example of planets labels with a yes. Even though Earth was not one of the planets the Kepplar probe analyzed we still calculated the resepective values and added it to the dataset as a good testing example.
