Our object with this project is to take the kepplar exoplanet database to train two different classifiers and classify unseen exoplanets as either "In the habitiable zone" or "Not in the habitiable zone". We chose to use two different classifiers because we wanted one to be a high bias model and the other to be a high variance model. So we chose a perceptron and a random forest ensemble.
